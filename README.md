## 👋 Hi there, I'm Nufil

🎓 I'm a passionate **C++ programmer** and developer focused on building data-structure-rich academic projects and real-world simulations. I love designing complex systems using custom implementations — no STL, just raw logic and clean OOP.

🔧 I specialize in:
- 📌 C++ with a focus on **custom data structures** (Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks, BSTs)
- 📚 Building full-fledged academic projects like **Solitaire**, **Gmail clones**, and **Airline Reservation Systems**
- 🧠 Algorithm design and memory-efficient implementations
- 🛠️ Teaching, mentoring, and preparing **ideal solutions** for student assignments

🚀 Currently worked on:
- ✈️ A full-featured **Flight Reservation System** using only linked lists, BSTs, and queues
- ♠️ C++ conversion of the **Klondike Solitaire** game (no STL)
- 📩 A Gmail-like **email manager** built with generic programming principles
