## 👋 Hey, I'm Nufil

🎯 I'm a systems and  developer who loves building everything from low-level logic games to complete web platforms. I work extensively in **C++**, **NASM**, and modern **JavaScript stacks**, always striving for clean design and optimal performance.

---

### 🛠️ Tech I'm Good At:

#### ⚙️ Low-Level & Systems Programming
- 🔢 **C++** (custom DS: Stack, Queue, DLL, BST — no STL!)
- 🧩 **NASM x86 Assembly** (developed a **Sudoku Game** project)
- 🃏 **Games & Simulations** – Klondike Solitaire in C++

#### 🌐 Full Stack Web Development
- 💻 **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript
- ⚙️ **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- 🗄️ **Database**: MySQL
- 🎯 **Web Projects**: Ready to build full web apps from scratch

---

### 💡 Projects I've Built:

- ✈️ **Flight Reservation System (C++)** – Fully custom with BST, Queue, Linked Lists
- ♠️ **Solitaire Game (C++)** – Object-oriented design with rule enforcement and stack logic
- 🔢 **Sudoku Game (NASM)** – A playable, logic-based Sudoku implemented in pure x86 Assembly
- 📩 **Gmail-like Mail System (C++)** – Email simulation using only Linked Lists and file I/O
- 🌐 **Web Projects** – Ready to take on full-stack apps using Node, SQL, and modern frontend
